-------------------------


Purpose
~~~~~~~

include::create-hive-table-purpose.txt[]

Syntax
~~~~~~

----
$ sqoop create-hive-table (generic-args) (create-hive-table-args)
$ sqoop-create-hive-table (generic-args) (create-hive-table-args)
----

Although the Hadoop generic arguments must preceed any create-hive-table
arguments, the create-hive-table arguments can be entered in any order
with respect to one another.


include::common-args.txt[]

.Hive arguments:
[grid="all"]
`-----------------------------`-------------------------------------------
Argument                      Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
+\--hive-home <dir>+          Override +$HIVE_HOME+
+\--hive-overwrite+           Overwrite existing data in the Hive table.
+\--create-hive-table+        If set, then the job will fail if the target hive
                              table exits. By default this property is false.
+\--hive-table <table-name>+  Sets the table name to use when importing \
                              to Hive.
+\--table+                    The database table to read the \
                              definition from.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

include::output-args.txt[]

Do not use enclosed-by or escaped-by delimiters with output formatting
arguments used to import to Hive. Hive cannot currently parse them.

Example Invocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define in Hive a table named +emps+ with a definition based on a
database table named +employees+:

----
$ sqoop create-hive-table --connect jdbc:mysql://db.example.com/corp \
