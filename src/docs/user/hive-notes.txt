Schema Definition in Hive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hive users will note that there is not a one-to-one mapping between
SQL types and Hive types. In general, SQL types that do not have a
direct mapping (for example, +DATE+, +TIME+, and +TIMESTAMP+) will be coerced to
+STRING+ in Hive. The +NUMERIC+ and +DECIMAL+ SQL types will be coerced to
+DOUBLE+. In these cases, Sqoop will emit a warning in its log messages
informing you of the loss of precision.
