The +codegen+ tool generates Java classes which encapsulate and
interpret imported records. The Java definition of a record is
instantiated as part of the import process, but can also be performed
separately. For example, if Java source is lost, it can be recreated.
New versions of a class can be created which use different delimiters
between fields, and so on.
