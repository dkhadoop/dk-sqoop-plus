The +import-all-tables+ tool imports a set of tables from an RDBMS to HDFS.
Data from each table is stored in a separate directory in HDFS.

For the +import-all-tables+ tool to be useful, the following conditions
must be met:

- Each table must have a single-column primary key.
- You must intend to import all columns of each table.
- You must not intend to use non-default splitting column, nor impose
  any conditions via a +WHERE+ clause.
