Controlling Distributed Cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sqoop will copy the jars in $SQOOP_HOME/lib folder to job cache every
time when start a Sqoop job. When launched by Oozie this is unnecessary
since Oozie use its own Sqoop share lib which keeps Sqoop dependencies
in the distributed cache. Oozie will do the localization on each
worker node for the Sqoop dependencies only once during the first Sqoop
job and reuse the jars on worker node for subsquencial jobs. Using
option +--skip-dist-cache+ in Sqoop command when launched by Oozie will
skip the step which Sqoop copies its dependencies to job cache and save
massive I/O.
