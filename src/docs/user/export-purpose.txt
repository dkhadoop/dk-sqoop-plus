The +export+ tool exports a set of files from HDFS back to an RDBMS.
The target table must already exist in the database. The input files
are read and parsed into a set of records according to the
user-specified delimiters. 

The default operation is to transform these into a set of +INSERT+
statements that inject the records into the database. In "update mode,"
Sqoop will generate +UPDATE+ statements that replace existing records
in the database, and in "call mode" Sqoop will make a stored procedure
call for each record.
