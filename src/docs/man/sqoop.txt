NAME
----
sqoop - The SQL-to-Hadoop database import/export tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
'sqoop' <tool-name> <tool-options>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Sqoop is a tool designed to help users of large data import existing
relational databases or mainframe datasets into their Hadoop clusters.
Sqoop interfaces with
databases via JDBC, importing the contents of tables into HDFS while
generating Java classes so users can interpret the table's schema.
Sqoop can also run in reverse, exporting records back from HDFS to a
relational data store.

Both SequenceFile and text-based targets are supported. Sqoop
also supports high-performance imports from select databases including MySQL.

OPTIONS
-------

Sqoop must be run with a particular tool specified. The options for
each tool depend on which tool is chosen.

Run 'sqoop help' for a list of all available tools.

Run 'sqoop help <tool-name>' for usage instructions for a particular
tool. Additional usage instructions are available for each tool in the
manual. e.g. 'sqoop-import(1)'.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

JAVA_HOME::
  As part of its import process, Sqoop generates and compiles Java code
  by invoking the Java compiler *javac*(1). As a result, JAVA_HOME must
  be set to the location of your JDK (note: This cannot just be a JRE).
  e.g., +/usr/java/default+. Hadoop (and Sqoop) requires Sun Java 1.6 which
  can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com.

HADOOP_COMMON_HOME::
  The location of the Hadoop Common files (specifically the bin/hadoop executable).
  If you installed Hadoop via RPM or DEB, this is in +/usr/lib/hadoop+.

HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME::
  The location of the Hadoop MapReduce files (specifically the JAR files).
  If you installed Hadoop via RPM or DEB, this is in +/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce+.

HIVE_HOME::
  If you are performing a Hive import, you must identify the location of
  Hive's jars and configuration. If you installed Hive via RPM or DEB,
  these are in +/usr/lib/hive+.

SEE ALSO
--------

The _Sqoop User Guide_ is available in HTML-form in '/usr/share/doc/sqoop/'
(if you installed via RPM or DEB), or in the 'docs/' directory if you
installed from a tarball.
