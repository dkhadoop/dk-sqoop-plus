OPTIONS
-------

One of the job operation arguments is required. 

Job management options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--create (job-id)::
  Define a new saved job with the specified job-id (name). A
  second Sqoop command-line, separated by a +--+ should be specified;
  this defines the saved job.

--delete (job-id)::
  Delete a saved job. (This deletes the job definition, but does not
  remove any data from HDFS.)

--exec (job-id)::
  Given a job id defined with +--create+, run the saved job. Any arguments
  following a +--+ are applied on top of the saved job, overriding the saved
  parameters.

--show (job-id)::
  Shows the parameters for a saved job

--list::
  List all saved jobs


Metastore connection options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Sqoop will use a private, local embedded database to store saved
jobs. An alternate metastore can be configured in +conf/sqoop-site.xml+. You
can also specify the metastore connect string here:

--meta-connect (jdbc-uri)::
  Specifies the JDBC connect string used to connect to the metastore


Common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--help::
  Print usage instructions

--verbose::
  Print more information while working
