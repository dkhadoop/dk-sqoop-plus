Input line parsing options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Record classes generated by Sqoop include both a +toString()+ method
that formats output records, and a +parse()+ method that interprets
text based on an input delimiter set. The input delimiters default to
the same ones chosen for output delimiters, but you can override these
settings to support converting from one set of delimiters to another.

--input-fields-terminated-by (char)::
  Sets the input field separator

--input-lines-terminated-by (char)::
  Sets the input end-of-line char

--input-optionally-enclosed-by (char)::
  Sets an input field-enclosing character

--input-enclosed-by (char)::
  Sets a required input field encloser

--input-escaped-by (char)::
  Sets the input escape character
