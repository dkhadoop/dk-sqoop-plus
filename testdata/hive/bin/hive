# This is a mock "Hive" shell that validates whether various test imports
# succeeded. It accepts commands of the form 'hive -f scriptname'
# and validates that the script contents match those of an expected script.
# The filename to that expected script is set via the environment variable
# EXPECTED_SCRIPT.

# The script will contain a pathname as part of the LOAD DATA INPATH statement;
# depending on where you run the tests from, this can change. So the expected
# script file actually contains the marker string "BASEPATH" which is replaced
# by this script with the contents of $TMPDIR, which is set to 'test.build.data'.
